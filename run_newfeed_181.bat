REM 181 NEW-FEED: ga80 feeds 105/129/137 x 3 bands = 9 cells (emptiest grid columns).
REM Map-coverage driven (F_r is off the objective as of 2026-07-25).

REM Console/stdout encoding (incident 2026-08-30): stdout here is REDIRECTED to a
REM log file, so Windows picks the ANSI codepage (cp949 on these boxes) for it and
REM a single em-dash in an lpopt log line raised UnicodeEncodeError -- that killed
REM a FINISHED 100-call campaign before report.md / delivery.json were written.
REM PYTHONIOENCODING pins the interpreter's stdio to utf-8; chcp 65001 makes the
REM console agree when the run is watched live.  Both are setlocal-scoped and do
REM not reach MASTER.
